receipient, you can merge multiple notificaiton in one mail.

That mean, if a user get comment notification for his blog article.

```
 c = @article.comments.create(:user => @jon, :text => "i love this article!")
 # if this invoke , when @user = @article.user
 @user.notify(c)
 # send to email
```

with this module

```
 c1 = @article.comments.create(:user => @jon, :text => "i love this article!")
 c2 = @article.comments.create(:user => @ken, :text => "i hate this article!")
 # if this invoke
 @user.buffer.notify(c1)
 @user.buffer.notify(c2)
 # these two methods would be translated to
 @user.merge_notify([c1,c2])
 # then you can build other notification email with arryed comment objects
